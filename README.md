JMEOS library for MobilityDB has been performed as the Master Thesis of the MSc in Computer Science of ULB.
A report with the detailed information is available in the thesis [folder](https://github.com/nmareghn/MobilityDB-JMEOS/tree/test/thesis).

## Abstract

The increasing complexity and volume of spatiotemporal data in various domains necessitate efficient and accessible tools for data handling and analysis. MobilityDB, an open-source moving object database, has established itself as a pioneer tool in this landscape. However, with the emergence of big data, there‚Äôs an urgent requirement to exploit MobilityDB‚Äôs capabilities, through widely used programming languages, such as Python and Java. It‚Äôs within this context that JMEOS, a Java-based library, becomes relevant. It bridges the gap between Java applications and MobilityDB, allowing for the seamless integration of advanced temporal types and functionalities. The main focus of this thesis is the implementation of a Java binding of the MEOS library. To this end, we map the functionalities through JNR-FFI, a popular C foreign function interface. By means of it, we implement analogous MobilityDB spatiotemporal types such as TBox, FloatSpan, PeriodSet or TGeomPoint. Lastly, we perform unit tests and code analysis to ensure the functionality and reliability of JMEOS . We finish the thesis by implementing use case example to demonstrate its efficacy in real-world scenarios and benchmarking its performance against MobilityDB and MEOS.

## Features
Wrapper 

## Requirements
The project is based on MEOS and developed in Java
- üöÄ MobilityDB with MEOS
- üìù Maven 3.9.6
- ‚òï Java 21
### Dependencies
The following dependencies are obtained through Maven and are necessary to develop JMEOS.
- üîó JNR-FFI
- üõ†Ô∏è Maven Plugin
- ‚úÖ JUnit
- üåç Jts Core


## Installation
Installation of Java and Maven will not be detailed here since many tutorials exists online. The installation of MobilityDB with MEOS needs to follow these subsequent commands: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MobilityDB/MobilityDB
mkdir MobilityDB/build
cd MobilityDB/build
cmake -DMEOS=on ..
make
sudo make install
```

Concerning the dependencies, all of them were already included in the pom.xml file. It is highly recommended to use an IDE such as IntelliJ in order to seamlessly integrated all the components in the development environment.


## Javadoc
The Javadoc generated is available under the docs folder. 
It can be generated through the following command:
```java
mvn javadoc:javadoc
```

By default, the generated javadoc will be stored inside the **target** folder.

## Unit test
Multiple unit test were implemented and are located under the **test** folder. The folder is structured similarly to the source file, as enforced by Java/IntelliJ rules. 
The following command allows to run all test at once:
```java
mvn test
```
One can prefer running only one file (class):
```java
mvn test -Dtest="FileTest"
```
It is also possible to run only one method of a class:
```java
mvn test -Dtest="FileTest#method"
```


## Deployment

## Future work
-  **Error Handling Improvements**  
	- Address limitations in JNR-FFI documentation and debuggability. 
	- Enhance error handling in JMEOS for better debugging, especially with C library interfacing.
	- Aim for more informative feedback at the Java-native C code boundary, enhancing JMEOS robustness and     user-friendliness. 
-  **Test Coverage Improvements**  
	- Increase test coverage in future JMEOS iterations for improved reliability. 
	- While 100% coverage was not achievable within the thesis timeline, it remains a recommended goal. 
-  **Implementation of Remaining Methods**  
    - Complete the implementation of remaining JMEOS methods to unlock full library potential. 
    - Ensures JMEOS fully encapsulates MEOS C library functionality, broadening use case applicability. 
 -  **Addition of New Examples/Visual Examples**  
    - Implement additional example files using real-world data to demonstrate JMEOS functionalities. 
    - Create a diverse set of examples for applications like urban planning, environmental monitoring, and GIS. 
-  **Creation of New MEOS Bindings**  
    - Develop new bindings for languages such as C and JavaScript, expanding MobilityDB's developer community.          
    - Support diverse applications and foster a more inclusive user base, contributing to spatiotemporal data processing knowledge.
